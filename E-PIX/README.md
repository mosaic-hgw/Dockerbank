Current Version: 2.9.2 (September 2019)

The Record Linkage and ID Management solution E-PIX (Enterprise Identifier Cross Referencing) applies the propabilistic Fellegi-Sunter-algorithm and the Levenshtein distance to avoid duplicate participant entries. The independent software module facilitates participant management and multisite-aggregation of medical research data. Additionally, the correction of potential synonym errors is supported (i.e. false-negative record linkage).
